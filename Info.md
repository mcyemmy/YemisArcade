- Javascript code should always be minified and obfuscated before deployment for security reasons.
- Object-oriented - Has intrisic PropertiesData(Nouns) and funtionsMethods(Verbs). it is reusable and inheritable.
- Object-oriented in Javascripts allows inheritance but is not class-based
- undefine is no-assignment, null is empty-assignment. undefined*2=NaN, Null*2=0.
- Hoisting is a concept in Javascript in which you make reference to a variable before it is declared(or declared down the line), without getting an exception.
- A closure is an inner function that remember the environment in which it was created (without allowing external functions to change its parent's(or private) variable). And unlike functions that use local variables which are deleted when execution completes, they do not lose the value of their parents variable after execution has been completed.
