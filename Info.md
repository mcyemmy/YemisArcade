Javascript
Object-oriented - Has intrisic PropertiesData(Nouns) and funtionsMethods(Verbs). it is reusable and inheritable.
Object-oriented in Javascripts allows inheritance but is not class-based
undefine is no-assignment, null is null-assigned.
undefined*2=NaN, Null*2=0.
Hoisting is a concept in Javascript that lets you make reference to refer to a variable before it is declared(or declared down the line), without getting an exception.
A closure is an inner function that remember the environment in which it was created without allowing external functions to change its parent's(or private) variable. And unlike functions that use local variables which are deleted when execution completes, they do not lose the value of their parents variable after execution has been completed.

VCS / GIT
The version control System is a remote system that makes it possible to maintain a repository of code one place, which lets multiple developers work on it simultaneously
3 key ingredients of a Version control System are Repos, branches and Revision history
3 most common vcs are CVS, SVN and GIT. GIT is distributed, others are not.
Git's web-based hosting service is github. Competitors are mercurial/Bitbucket
