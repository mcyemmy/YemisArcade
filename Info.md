//Slaves and Children in Christ

-  You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love. Galatians 5:13

Devotion
- For we are not called unto greatness but unto faithfulness. Greatness is only a side reward for being faithful.
- People will be people but I will be Christ. Situations will be situations but I will choose the mind of Christ.
- Situations will always arise, feelings will always be aroused, but how you arrest them and react is what determines your character.
- The level of emotional control(self-control) determines the level of closeness to God. Put your emotions under check and prevent the devil from using it against you.
- Use what God has blessed you with as a means to encourage and lift others up, not as a means to brag or put people down
- If you don't  follow the manufacturer's manual, everything will be in error.
- God our Father at creation have placed a seed in us and we do not bear fruit unless we tend and cultivate the seed that God has placed in us.
- Jesus is our “brand,” for we are being conformed to His image (Rom. 8:29). We attract others to Christ when we put on His attributes, which include tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, long suffering (Col. 3:12), and, above all, love (v.14).
- Do not look at things from a distorted negative view. Look at it from a positive and Godly perspective. John 11:11
- Faith is believing that God is present even when all we hear is troubles. Rom. 8:38-39
- We must know who we are in Christ 1 Peter 2:9
- Always have an attitude of gratitude, Praising God at all time makes His unending mercies available, and His mercy is probably all the is needed to enjoy a glorious ending in life. Proclaiming God’s mercy and faithfulness silences discontentment, think about the good things that He has done not the ones yet to be seen. O Lord, grow in me an attitude of fullness in You. In all of life situation, never speak against God.
- When you pray, be helpless before God because Prayer is the child’s helpless cry to the Father’s attentive ear. Psalm 121:1
- Resting in God always, even when the tide is against me.
- Help me to remember, like Jeremiah, that my hope comes from You, not from my circumstances.
- It is the same rain that falls on bitterleaf that also falls on sugarcane. Choose your destiny wisely.
- Do not store up earthly treasures for yourself but pursue heavenly treasures instead. Our character is the Bible that other people read. Let your life reflect Jesus to people. Self-Denial
