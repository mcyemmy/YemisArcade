Devotion
- For we are not called unto greatness but unto faithfulness. Greatness is only a side reward for being faithful.
- People will be people but I will be Christ. Situations will be situations but I will choose the mind of Christ.
- Situations will always arise, feelings will always be aroused, but how you arrest them and react is what determines your character.
- The level of emotional control(self-control) determines the level of closeness to God. Put your emotions under check and prevent the devil from using it against you.
- Always have an attitude of gratitude, Praising God at all time makes His unending mercies available, and His mercy is probably all the is needed to enjoy a glorious ending in life. Proclaiming God’s mercy and faithfulness silences discontentment, think about the good things that He has done not the ones yet to be seen. O Lord, grow in me an attitude of fullness in You. In all of life situation, never speak against God.
- Resting in God always, even when the tide is against me.
- Help me to remember, like Jeremiah, that my hope comes from You, not from my circumstances.
- It is the same rain that falls on bitterleaf that also falls on sugarcane. Choose your destiny wisely.
- Do not store up earthly treasures for yourself but pursue heavenly treasures instead. Our character is the Bible that other people read. Let your life reflect Jesus to people. Self-Denial
